      <span class="paragraphofAbout">
      The reason Kayla Tinker started the private pet sitting and services company was to help 
      relieve stress of all the pet owners in the NorthEast Kingdom who had 9-5 jobs that took them away from their animals
      for long periods of time, for those who liked to travel, and for those who love their pets, but just have too much on their plates.
      Throughout her education and career, Kayla always made time to be around animals. From fostering dogs while in CT, to luxury pet sitting
      in NYC. Now she wants to bring this amazing service to northern Vermont.
      We are a family owned local small business that is fully bonded and insured.
